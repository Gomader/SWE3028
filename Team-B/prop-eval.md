#### Suggestions (from other teams)
* Requires user study; only based on TO-DOs
* Investigates any alternatives?
* New functionalities added?

#### Comments
* The concept of sharing one's resolution (goal) with others 
  to maximize achievement looks an interesting topic.
* Can you introduce a similar service or mobile application
  because tons of other study planners are out there?
  What features does it have? Is there any problem if any?
* How many members would be appropriate per group study?
  It seems that you may limit the number of participants per group.
* How about narrowing down the scope? For instance, study groups
  for SAT (대수능), English or public service exam (공시)
  instead of general ones? It can help you to define
  functionalities in detail, distingushing from existing services.
* A reward/penalty sounds promising, but how do you implement it?
* Can you provide a project plan in detail with a timeline 
  (e.g., week1, week2, ...) as well as members and roles?

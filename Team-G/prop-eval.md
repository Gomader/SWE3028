#### Feedback (from other teams)
- [+] useful proposal; realistic idea
- [+] well presented in the study of previous work
- [+] problem clearly defined and worth addressing
- [+] role distribution and schedule are fair/good
- [+] good collaboration plan
- [+] impressive scheduling chart
- [-] missing how to build a model from prior work
- [-] lack of problem clarification
- [-] distinguishing points compared to similar apps or service
- [-] skewed model depending on a training dataset for learning
- [-] trivial solution
- [-] require a project plan in detail
- [-] absence of how each feature works

#### Suggestions / Questions (from other teams)
* Investigate in-depth study of previous approaches (rather than look up)
* Would be great that the proposal has the feature of user’s preference
* Investigate a better solution?
* Not sure how prior work helps to resolve the problem
* Practicality is questionable on a fashion matching application

#### Comments
* The attempt to seek a recommendation for fashion-blinded people looks quite interesting.
* The most challenging part seems to define a metric for evaluation.
  This is simply because a choice of items for fashion can be quite subjective depending
  on one’s preference. Can you borrow some ideas on metrics from prior work?
* In a similar vein, as one of your classmates pointed out, the learned model 
  highly relies on a training dataset initially, leading a skewed result during testing.
* Are you going to manually label a match (i.e., mapping)? 
  Say, a shirt “X” well matches a skirt “Y”?
  If so, what would be an input and output for building your model?
 * Can you provide a project plan in detail with a timeline 
   (e.g., week1, week2, ...) as well as members and roles?

### [Team A: jjangdol] GANdanhan font maker

#### Feedback (from other teams)
- [+] useful/interesting idea (e.g., free from copyright)
- [+] good motivation
- [+] potentially attractive platform 
- [+] practical solution
- [+] well defined for individual roles
- [+] thorough explanation of background and related work
- [+] problem clearly stated
- [+] meaningful open source
- [-] lack of distinguishing points from the existing idea or service 
- [-] many alternatives (overlapping idea)
- [-] lack of study on prior work, especially the one from Naver
- [-] comparison with other techniques not using GAN
- [-] 300-400 user inputs might be too much
- [-] the output might not be worthwhile considering the efforts to be made

#### Suggestions (from other teams)
* Defining case study
* Clarifying additional features for improving the existing service

#### Comments
* Overall, the idea looks good and appropriate for a team project
* Is there any free of charge API for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
  that recognizes Korean?
* [NAVER CLOVA](https://clova.ai/m/handwriting) says that it employs 256 letters 
  for generating a unique handwriting. Hence I think that taking 300 inputs 
  from a user makes sense. 
* Are you going to apply the same model proposed by GlyphGAN? 
  As you stated, the model may not work well for Korean characters.
  Maybe you need a better model.
* Can you provide a project plan with a timeline  (e.g., week1, week2, ...)
  as well as members and roles?

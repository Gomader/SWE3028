### Guidelines for Final Presentations
 - Objective and motivation (brief heads-up)
 - Project Progress (during the whole Fall semester)
    - Real schedule with milestones: no need to mention initial planning
    - Role of each member
 - Final Design
 - Final Implementation
 - Challenges
    - Methods or ideas to address those challenges
    - Trial and error to get better results
 - ML/DL based projects
   - Dataset: corpus (training:validation:test)
   - Model description (e.g., algorithm)
   - Input and output
   - Evaluation metrics
   - Main hyperparameters (e.g., batch size, epoch, ...)
 - Limitation: constraint, assumption
 - Evaluations: showing off results
 - Demonstration

### Guidelines for Final Reports
 - Format: LNCS using LaTeX (the same with a proposal)
 - 10-12 pages in total
 - Title and Authors (project members)
 - Abstract
 - Keywords: choose 3-5 main keywords to represent your project
 - Introduction
   - General statement
   - Briefly state what makes your project interesting (motivation)
   - Concisely state your proposal and goal
   - Briefly state what technique/approach you have taken
   - Summerize your design and implementation
   - State your achivement with empirical evaluations
 - Related work
   - Describe relevant techniques/approaches of previous works
   - Describe the position of your work: how your proposal differ from prior ones
 - Proposed system/solution/service
   - Describe an overall architecture
   - Describe a core skill/technique/model: e.g., DM-Font
   - Describe general challenges and how you tackle them
 - Design
   - Describe reasoning about your design choice
   - Describe your ML model/algorithm (if any)
   - Describe the design from UX/UI viewpoints (you do not need to capture all pages of a web/app)
 - Implementation
   - Describe the frontend and backend in detail from an implementation perspective
   - Describe your dataset for machine learning (if any)
   - Enumerate all open sources taken (if any) and how you tweak them
 - Limitations and Discussions
   - Discuss assumptions
   - Discuss constraints and limitations
 - Evaluation
   - Describe evaulation metrics, hyperparams and input/outputs for ML (if any)
   - Demonstrate empirical results
   - Assess your system/model meets the objective of the project
 - Conclusion

### Evaluation criteria (100 points)
 - Final Design: UI/UX (20 points)
   - Is the web/app design or a model (for ML/DL) well designed?
 - Final Implementation: frontend/backend (20 points)
   - Is the final implementation useful/helpful for others?
 - Demonstration (20 points)
   - Is the demo working seamlessly to achieve the objective of a project?
 - Documentation (20 points)
   - Final report
   - Git repository operation with documentation (i.e., README.md)
 - Final Presentation (20 points)
   - Is the idea concisely and accurately conveyed?

### Presentation
 - Either recording a video clip or live
 - 12 minute presentation including demonstration (hard limit)
 - 5 minute Q&A (at the end of each presentation)
 - Spoken in English

#### Suggestions / Questions  (from other teams)
* Narrow down the scope of the problem (too vast)
* Infeasible to achieve the goal within a semester
* Require more team communications
* Relationship between COVID and the need for developing this service seems questionable

#### Comments
* As discussed in a separate meeting, you must narrow down the scope of the project 
 (slide p.10).  You need to set up a clear goal. If you want to build a model for better
  performance in prediction, say, buy or sell, then you could compare 
  a previous approach X with yours.
  You can focus on a couple of stocks (possibly with large variations) to start with.
* It would be good to begin with a prior model if any. Securities firm offers Open APIs  
  for development/testing purposes (e.g., [Kiwoom OpenAPI](https://www.kiwoom.com/h/customer/download/VOpenApiInfoView). 
* It requires more study on existing solutions (slide 9): i) what information is redundant?,
  ii) which part of the algorithm makes it inefficient?, iii) misleading prediction happens 
  all the time because of the nature of the stock market, thus you can say, for example, that 
  the previous prediction rate is XX, our goal is to gain 5% more.
* Can you provide a project plan in detail with a timeline 
   (e.g., week1, week2, ...) as well as members and roles?
* Do you target a stock market or cryptocurrency one?

### Suggestions / Questions  (from other teams)
* Adding more features may be helpful
* Investigate a problem further for finding insights
* Challenging problem that seems to require much efforts; should go step by step
* Require to deal with corner cases like an imaginary number
* What is the difference between this proposal and the QANDA service?
* How do you handle a non-standardized (varying) format?
* How do you match problem numbers with the numbers in the answer sheet?

### Comments
 * Overall, the goal looks quite interesting and straightforward.
 * Seems that this project has several challenges. For example,
   each book may have a different format (layout) when recognizing the area of a problem.
   How can you handle the case where answers are in multiple locations like slide 7?
 * Do you plan to leverage the concept of both YOLO and TLGAN into your model?
 * Is the project including the feature of recognizing math equations (slide 11)?
 * As mentioned in class, please focus on math problems with multiple choices.
   You may have to deal with corner cases (i.e., pre-processing).
 * Can you provide a project plan in detail with a timeline 
   (e.g., week1, week2, ...) as well as members and roles?

#### Suggestions (from other teams)

* Investigate existing approaches

#### Comments
* The core idea of this project is _to provide an explainable model_ for stock investors.
  In the same vein, the title seems misleading, so change it into the one including the core idea.
* The overall idea looks promising, yet it lacks many details.
  If you cannot disclose your idea at all, it seems difficult to proceed your project.
* The `Divide and Conquer` strategy must be specific. 
  As pointed out by other teams, the proposal requires the definition of the scope.
  Please begin with a small problem (circumstance). A few stocks may suffice to keep trace.
* Can you introduce at least one publication?
  e.g., [AI-based approaches for profitable investment and trading in stock market](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321012700)
* Can you provide a project plan in detail with a timeline 
  (e.g., week1, week2, ...) as well as members and roles?

### [Team D: EDITH] End-to-end anime photo editing

#### Feedback (from other teams): incomplete (B/H only) 
- [+] interesting idea
- [+] good scheduling
- [-] solution looks irrelevant (i.e., suggesting image generation rather than animation)
- [-] lack of plans in detail
- [-] lack of role distribution
- [-] require more study on prior work
- [-] distinct properties or differences from prior work?

#### Suggestions (from other teams): incomplete
* Define art styles clearly as it could be varying

#### Comments
* Overall, the proposal looks very interesting.
* Motivation is clear.
* Anime photo editing in the title (goal) includes too broad. 
  I suggest one feature out of three (i.e., inpainting, colorizing, and image style)
  because each topic seems to have many things to consider. 
  For example, considering colorizing, you may have to focus on a specific item 
  for learning like shoes in slide p14. I do not think building a generic model
  to colorize any item in the world is an appropriate scope of a capstone project.
  Also, note that the papers you referred to focus on resolving each technique.
* Is the proposal about reproducing previous approaches like combining the above
  different techniques to apply your “anime photo editing” service?
* In slide p9, when a user uploads an image, how do your system figure out
  which editing is required? 
* Can you provide a project plan in detail with a timeline 
   (e.g., week1, week2, ...) as well as members and roles?
